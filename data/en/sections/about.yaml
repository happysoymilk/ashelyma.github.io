summary: 'Iâ€™m an aspiring data scientist with a special interest in the business field. Tech fascinates me and I love connecting with people who share my passion for data visualisation, data analytics, and machine learning. I love digging into business problems and solving them with modern technology. 
I am self-driven and hard-working. I enjoy a multicultural work environment and sharing new knowledge with others. Also, I am a quick learner and adapter, which can be proven that I changed my major 3 times during 6 years.              '
